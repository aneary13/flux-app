# FLUX - Frontend Application

This is the React Native (Expo) frontend for **FLUX**, a premium biological training engine. 

The app acts as a "Thin Client"—it focuses on delivering a beautiful, offline-tolerant, and highly responsive user experience, while deferring complex progression math and session generation to the FastAPI backend.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Framework:** React Native / Expo
* **Routing:** Expo Router (File-based routing)
* **State Management:** Zustand
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Build System:** EAS (Expo Application Services)

## 🧠 State Management

The application relies on **Zustand** for state management, split into two distinct domains to prevent unnecessary re-renders:

1. `useUserStore`: Holds the user's current "Biological State" (Pattern Debts and Conditioning Levels). It is refreshed via `useFocusEffect` every time the user navigates back to the Home screen (`app/index.tsx`).
2. `useSessionStore`: Handles the highly dynamic state of an active workout. It logs completed sets, manages background block timers, and gathers notes. It is intentionally cleared (`clearSession()`) upon completing a workout.

## 🎨 Design System
The UI adheres to a "Premium Biological Tech" aesthetic. We avoid raw numbers for biological states where possible, favoring color-coded readiness bars defined in theme/index.ts:

* **Sage Green** (`#8FA58A`): Fully Primed
* **Earthy Sand** (`#D4A373`): Priming / Recovering
* **Dusty Rose** (`#CD7B7B`): Fatigued / Engine Cooling

## 🚀 Usage & Development Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` root directory. Do **not** commit this file.

```
# For local dev via tunneling or direct Render URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-flux-backend.onrender.com
```

### 2. Running Locally

Install dependencies and start the Expo development server:

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

*Note: If testing on a physical device on a strict Wi-Fi network, run `npx expo start --tunnel` to bypass AP isolation.*

### 3. Building for Production (Android APK)

The app is configured via `eas.json` to build a standalone Android `.apk` for direct installation. The production API URL is baked into the EAS preview profile.

To trigger a cloud build:

```bash
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

Once the build completes, scan the generated QR code with your Android device to download and install the app.
