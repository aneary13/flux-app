# Frontend (legacy)

The FLUX web app has been moved to **`../web`** (Next.js 14, App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, Shadcn/UI).

To run the web app:

```bash
cd ../web
npm install
npm run dev
```

The previous Expo/React Native app has been removed as part of the Schema 3.0 frontend implementation.
